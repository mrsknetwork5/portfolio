# Security Policy

## Overview
This repository contains a personal portfolio and blog website hosted on GitHub Pages. As this project includes personal details and sensitive content, it is essential to implement security best practices to avoid data breaches.

## Personal Information
This project may contain personal information that is not intended for public use. Please ensure the following measures are taken to protect sensitive data:

- Personal details should be kept out of public repositories.

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Sensitive Data Management
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials, in environment variables. Do not hardcode them into your codebase.
- **Configuration Files**: Use configuration files (e.g., `.env`) that are included in your `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive data from being committed.

### 2. Access Control
- **Repository Privacy**: Ensure that your GitHub repository is private if it contains sensitive information or content that you do not wish to share publicly.
- **Branch Protection Rules**: Implement branch protection rules to prevent unauthorized changes to the main branch.

### 3. Regular Updates
- **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies to their latest versions to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Security Audits**: Conduct periodic security audits of your codebase to identify and address potential security issues.

### 4. Content Moderation
- **Blog Content**: Be cautious when posting personal information or sensitive topics on your blog. Avoid disclosing any information that may compromise your privacy or security.
- **Comment Sections**: If you implement a comments section on your blog, consider moderating comments to prevent spam or malicious content.
